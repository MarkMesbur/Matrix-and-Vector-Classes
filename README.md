# Matrix-and-Vector-Classes

Matrix, vector and banded matrix object oriented program I built using c++. Also included are conjugate gradient and steepest descent methods.

I used this program throughout my academic career at the University of Manchester. It is helpful for matrix analysis, numerical linear algebra and machine learning.
